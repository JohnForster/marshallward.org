I just finished playing Analogue: A Hate Story" by Christine Love, and am now
going through the spiritual precessor "Digital: A Love Story".

At one point, you get a mysterious message from another user after a system
crash, including a binary sequence, which is in ASCII. I thought it was a clue
to the password for a certain BBS, so I tried to decode it. Turns out it is
actually just a hidden message:

    "my name is emilia i was born to understand poetry but accidentally fell in
    love"

I have to admit that I cheated a bit to get the binary sequence by grepping the
RenPy files, so I might have botched the cut and paste (some words were missing
spaces). It's not a terribly shocking revelation to anyone who has played
Analogue, but it is a fun message to find in the game.
