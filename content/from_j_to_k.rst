This is the first chance that I've had to write since we left for Japan. I have
managed to keep internet contact while in Japan thanks to the `b-mobile sim
card`_. You can buy a six-month card in stores for about 20,000 yen, or you can
order a one-month card online for about 3,000 yen (delivered to your hotel, or
example), although the site is completely in Japanese, and Google translate
tends to break websites with forms. Luckily, I was able to get Jules (who lives
in Japan) to order one for me! The SIM is fantastic, it provides unlimited data
download and we've had coverage everywhere we went. It's helped out in finding
accommodation, restaurants, and just about anything else, and Google translate
has gotten us out of a few awkward conversations. I can't imagine travelling
without it.

While is what is going to make travelling through Korea more difficult.
Elizabeth speaks Korean, but without mobile data we're going to be dependent on
maps, guide books, and information kiosks. While is normal for everyone else,
but how can I ever go back to that way of life??

Hopefully I will get a chance to write about the actual trip at some later
time, but mostly I just wanted to check in and say that I am still alive.
Tonight we are in Hiroshima and tomorrow we catch the ferry from Japan to
Korea, which should be a whole new adventure.
