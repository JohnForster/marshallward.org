Apologies for the messy website. I am experimenting more with Pelican and trying
to create my own website theme. That means not only learning Pelican in more
detail, but also Jinja2 and even basic HTML and CSS, which I haven't seriously
looked at since the 90's.

The results so far aren't exactly pretty. But I suppose it's about time I
learned some proper internet skills.
