I recently gave a talk to the latest COMA meeting in Melbourne, giving a rough
overview of the performance of a 0.25-degree global MOM simulation on the
Raijin supercomputer. It was a great meeting, I think we all learned a lot
about each others' MOM projects, with a lot of room for future collaboration.

The notes are available here_.
