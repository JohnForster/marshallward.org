I recently presented a talk at the `2013 Winter School`_ for the `Centre of
Excellence for Climate System Science`_ about supercomputers and how climate
scientists should think about them as research tools.

I also took the bold step of preparing the talk in restructuredText and S5,
producing a reasonably nice looking HTML talk. It wasn't completely effortless
to move it to the website, mostly because it was using a local reference to a
CSS file. And I still struggle a little with Pelican's static content
management. But I think it looks OK.

No need to worry if you missed the winter school. You can look through the talk
