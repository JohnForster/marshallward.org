Threading in Thunderbird
========================

I mostly use GMail for personal emails, but I still access my work email
through Thunderbird. In fact, I often tell myself that the days of the email
client are numbered, and I should already be doing everyone on the web. I have
occasionally considered piping it through GMail, but then I start worrying
about storing all of my work emails on Google computers, and decide to just
stick with Thunderbird. It's a bit of a headache managing the app on every
computer I use, but it mostly works.

One of these nusiances is the lack of threaded emails. Thunderbird has some
default threading, but it doesn't combine the Inbox and Sent folders, and you
just end up confusing yourself. I finally hit my tolerance threshold and
started searching for a solution, and found the `Thunderbird Conversations`_
addon. It combines your Inbox and Sent folders and even makes the conversations
resemble GMail. This is such a strong feature that they ought to include it as
a default setting.

In the meantime, it looks like the email client may yet live another day.
