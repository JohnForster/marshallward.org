We've finally returned home from our trip about three weeks ago. Unfortunately,
I also became terribly sick after arriving home, which meant that I was out of
commission for another week. Two weeks later returning to work, I'm still
congested and coughing a bit. The timing was not good, I had to finish a review
and also prepare for a conference presentation. I managed to get everything
done, but the presentation could have gone better. I received a few
compliments, but I did get some pointed questions and one never hears about the
criticisms. Given that this is the twilight of my academic career, I'm not very
worried about it, and I'm more relieved that it's over. I haven't been able to
give much thought to the upcoming career shift, and it will be good to start
the new role.

Sadly, I recently heard that my friend Matt has been in a terrible car
accident, and was in critical condition at the hospital. The last news was that
his condition is improving, but I haven't heard anything for the last couple of
days. I am thinking of you every day, Matt, and hoping that you pull through
this.
