Fourier's Death
===============

A recent TIL (today-i-learned) in Reddit suggests a comical story of Fourier's
death being due to a tumble down the stairs:

    `TIL French mathematician Joseph Fourier`_ believed wrapping his body in a
    blanket was beneficial to his health. He died after tripping on it and
    falling down the stairs.

However, the "reference" is to a uncited Wolfram ScienceWorld article, at best
an anecdote, and Wikipedia simply links to this article. Having never heard
this story, I was skeptical.

I located a Gutenberg-copy of `this book`_ which devotes a section to Fourier's
final days. It makes no mention of a deadly trip down the stairs, but it does
contain a few anecdotes to explain the rumour:

    "[O]ur colleague was in the habit of clothing himself, even in the hottest
    season of the year, after a fashion which is not practised even by
    travellers condemned to spend the winter amid the snows of the polar
    regions."

while on an unrelated note:

    "Fourier had already experienced, in Egypt and Grenoble, some attacks of
    aneurism of the heart... A fall, however, which he sustained on the 4th of
    May, 1830, while descending a flight of stairs, aggravated the malady to an
    extent beyond what could have been ever feared."

He died shortly afterwards.

I suppose one can fill in the blanks with an imaginative story of tripping down
the stairs from a thick blanket, but I have yet to find any testimony to
support this version of events. Hopefully I, or someone else, will find time to
clean up the Wikipedia article before the rumour spreads.
